# Architecture Decisions

## ADR-001 — Generic product name

Decision: Use Dashboard Studio as the product and repository identity.

Reason: Metabase is one source and Sophia is one destination. The core capability is generic migration, design, validation, and publishing.

## ADR-002 — Proper Frappe app

Decision: Build a separate Frappe app installed in the same Frappe/ERPNext site.

Reason: The product requires modular Python, managed DocTypes, permissions, background jobs, tests, and secure server integrations.

## ADR-003 — Metadata-driven dashboards

Decision: Store datasets, metrics, components, layouts, and filters as structured records.

Reason: Normal dashboard changes should not require replacement of large Python and JavaScript files.

## ADR-004 — AI proposes, server validates

Decision: AI produces structured proposals only.

Reason: Prevent arbitrary SQL execution, restricted-field exposure, and unapproved publishing.

## ADR-005 — Incremental migration

Decision: Keep existing dashboards and migrate one validated vertical slice at a time.

Reason: Reduces operational risk and enables result-parity checks.
